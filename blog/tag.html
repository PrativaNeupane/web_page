           <h3> When we were children, Hassan and I used to climb the poplar trees in the driveway of my father’s house and annoy our neighbors by reflecting sunlight into their homes with a shard of mirror.
             We would sit across from each other on a pair of high branches, our naked feet dangling, our trouser pockets filled with dried mulberries and walnuts.
              We took turns with the mirror as we ate mulberries, pelted each other with them, giggling, laughing. 
              I can still see Hassan up on that tree, sunlight flickering through the leaves on his almost perfectly round face, a face like a Chinese doll chiseled from hardwood: his flat, broad nose and slanting,
               narrow eyes like bamboo leaves,
               eyes that looked, depending on the light, gold, green, even sapphire. I can still see his tiny low-set ears and that pointed stub of a chin, a meaty appendage that looked like it was added as a mere afterthought. 
               And the cleft lip, just left of midline, where the Chinese doll maker’s instrument may have slipped, or perhaps he had simply grown tired and careless.</h3>

                <h3>Sometimes, up in those trees, I talked Hassan into firing walnuts with his slingshot at the neighbor’s one-eyed German shepherd.
                     Hassan never wanted to, but if I asked, really asked, he wouldn’t deny me. 
                     Hassan never denied me anything. And he was deadly with his slingshot. Hassan’s father, Ali, used to catch us and get mad, or as mad as someone as gentle as Ali could ever get.
                      He would wag his finger and wave us down from the tree. He would take the mirror and tell us what his mother had told him, 
                      that the devil shone mirrors too, shone them to distract Muslims during prayer. 
                      "And he laughs while he does it," he always added, scowling at his son.</h3>

                - testing friendships, finding love, cheating death, accepting faults, and gaining understanding. Living in Afghanistan in the 1960s, 
                Amir enjoys a life of privilege that is shaped by his brotherly friendship with Hassan, his servant's son.
                 Amir lives in constant want of his father's attention, feeling that he is a failure in his father's eyes. Hassan, on the other hand, seems to be able to do no wrong.
                  Their friendship is a complex tapestry of love, loss, privilege, and shame.
                  Striving to be the son his father always wanted, Amir takes on the weight of living up to ...</h3>
